# Question 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

Given a string `s`, find the length of the *longest substring* without repeating characters.

## Example 1:
```
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
```

## Example 2:
```
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
```

Notice that the answer must be a substring, `"pwke"` is a subsequence and not a substring.

## Constraints:
- `0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104`
- `s` consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.

# My Solution

```python
class Solution(object):
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: int
        """
        length, start, end = 0, 0, 0
        while start <= end < len(s):
            index = s[start:end].find(s[end])
            if index == -1:
                end += 1
            start += (index + 1)
            length = max(length, end - start)
        return length
```
